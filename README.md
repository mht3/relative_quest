# relative_quest
We propose 'Relative Quest': a tool that will explore kinship using GERMLINE combined with Estimations of Recent Shared Ancestry (ERSA).

## Dataset

Download 1000Genomes [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CPK7M0g62NIsAbrEgZ3WhLuMi04KhnXu/view?usp=sharing).

Sample GERMLINE input files (.map & .ped) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hzw5Z9CKX2gBfwGjbbKBB7des02fDM8y/view?usp=sharing)

you can install `rq` with the following command:

```
python setup.py install
```

Note: if you do not have root access, you can run the commands above with additional options to install locally:
```
python setup.py install --user
```

If the install was successful, typing `rq --help` should show a useful message.
